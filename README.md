The objective of the Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster project is to apply machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. This project provides participants with a dataset containing information about passengers: age, sex, class, and other factors. The goal is to build a predictive model that, based on these features, can classify which passengers are likely to survive and which are not.
The project helps develop skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation.
